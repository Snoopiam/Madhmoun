# Documents Required to Obtain a Madhmoun Permit

One of the advantageous aspects of the Madhmoun system is its streamlined approach to documentation. Unlike many traditional permit systems that require extensive document uploads, Madhmoun leverages existing digital infrastructure and pre-verified information.

## What Documents Are NOT Required

It's important to first clarify that the following documents do NOT need to be uploaded during the permit application process:

* Broker licenses (already verified in the system)
* Company trade licenses (pre-registered)
* Title deeds (verified through certificate number)
* Property ownership documentation (verified through government databases)
* Landlord identification (verified through UAE Pass or account)
* Floor plans or property specifications (pulled from official records)
* Photographs of the property (not required for permit issuance)

## What Information IS Required

Instead of document uploads, the system requires:

### For Brokers/Agencies:
* Valid login credentials (UAE Pass)
* Access to company account with proper permissions
* Certificate number from the property's title deed or off-plan registration
* Permit specifications (duration, exclusivity status, etc.)

### For Property Management Companies:
* Valid login credentials (UAE Pass)
* Active property management agreement (pre-verified in system)
* Permit specifications (duration, etc.)

### For Developers:
* Valid login credentials (UAE Pass)
* Project registration information (pre-loaded in developer account)
* Broker assignment details for authorized advertisers

## Certificate Number: The Key Reference

The most important piece of information needed is the **certificate number** from:

* Title deed (for completed properties)
* Off-plan registration certificate (for off-plan properties)

This number allows the system to:
* Verify property existence and details
* Confirm ownership status
* Check for any restrictions or blocks
* Pull accurate property specifications

## Behind-the-Scenes Verification

Instead of requiring users to upload documents, Madhmoun conducts automated verification through:

1. Integration with the title deed system
2. Connection to the Tautiq registration database
3. Verification against broker licensing records
4. Checks against property management agreements
5. Validation of company information

## Special Cases

While standard permit applications require no document uploads, there may be exceptions:

* If system information is outdated or incorrect, support may request documentation
* For unusual property arrangements or special circumstances, additional verification may be required
* If technical issues arise with automatic verification, manual document provision might be necessary

## Benefits of the Streamlined Approach

This approach offers several advantages:

* **Faster Processing**: Applications can be completed in minutes
* **Reduced Errors**: Less manual data entry means fewer mistakes
* **Simplified Workflow**: Less administrative burden on real estate professionals
* **Data Consistency**: Property information is pulled from official sources
* **Enhanced Security**: Reduced risk of document tampering or fraud
