# Clarification on Madhmoun's Existence Without Permit Number

## Understanding Madhmoun's Purpose and Scope

There seems to be some confusion about whether the Madhmoun system exists solely as a permit system or serves a broader purpose. This clarification addresses when permits are required and the overall function of Madhmoun in the Abu Dhabi real estate market.

## Madhmoun: More Than Just Permits

Madhmoun is a comprehensive initiative to transform the Abu Dhabi real estate sector, with the permit system being just one component. Its broader purposes include:

1. **Market Transparency**: Creating a verified source of property information
2. **Professional Standards**: Elevating the quality of real estate services
3. **Data Standardization**: Unifying property information formats
4. **Transaction Security**: Building trust in the market
5. **Government Oversight**: Enabling better regulation and market analysis

## When Permits Are Required

The current permit system focuses specifically on **online advertising** of properties. A permit is required when:

* Posting property listings on websites (Bayut, Property Finder, etc.)
* Advertising properties on social media platforms
* Posting in public WhatsApp or messaging groups
* Listing properties on company websites
* Any public online communication about available properties

## When Permits Are Not Required

A permit is NOT mandatory for:

* Direct transactions between buyer and seller without online advertising
* Private communications between a broker and their client
* Internal communications between agents in the same company
* Completing a sale or rental transaction that was initiated without online advertising
* Discussing properties in private, non-public settings

## Practical Example

**Scenario 1**: A broker is contacted directly by a landlord to sell their property. The broker finds a buyer through their personal network without advertising online. In this case, no permit is required.

**Scenario 2**: A broker wants to advertise a property online to reach a wider audience. In this case, a permit must be obtained through the Madhmoun system before posting.

## Future Evolution

It's important to note that Madhmoun is being implemented in phases:

1. **Current Phase**: Focus on cleaning up online listings through the permit system
2. **Upcoming Phases**: Will address pricing verification, broker relationships, and transaction standards

Eventually, the system will likely become more comprehensive in regulating various aspects of real estate transactions, but the current requirement is specifically for online advertising.

## Key Takeaway

Madhmoun permits are a tool for regulating online property advertisements, not a mandatory requirement for all real estate transactions. The system aims to clean up the online property marketplace while allowing traditional business relationships to continue functioning with proper documentation and compliance.
