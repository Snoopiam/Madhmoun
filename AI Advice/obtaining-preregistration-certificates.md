# Guide to Obtaining Pre-Registration Certificates for Property Owners

## What is a Pre-Registration Certificate?

A pre-registration certificate (also called an off-plan registration certificate) is an official document issued for properties purchased directly from developers before construction completion. This certificate:

* Confirms the buyer's rights to the property
* Contains essential details about the unit and project
* Includes a unique certificate number needed for Madhmoun permits
* Serves as an interim document before the final title deed is issued

## How to Obtain a Certificate

If you are a property owner without a pre-registration certificate, you have several options to obtain one:

### Option 1: Contact the Developer Directly

1. **Prepare Required Documents**:
   * Original purchase agreement
   * Proof of identity (Emirates ID, passport)
   * Proof of payments made to date
   * Any assignment documents (if purchased from a previous buyer)

2. **Contact the Developer's Customer Service**:
   * Visit their office in person
   * Submit a formal request for the certificate
   * Provide all required documentation
   * Pay any applicable fees (varies by developer)

3. **Processing Time**:
   * Typically 3-7 business days
   * May be expedited for urgent cases

### Option 2: Access Through AdRec Platform

For many owners, the certificate may already be available digitally:

1. **Log in to the AdRec Platform**:
   * Visit www.dari.ae
   * Log in using UAE Pass (residents) or username/password (non-residents)

2. **Navigate to Contracts Section**:
   * Go to your user dashboard
   * Select the "Contracts" or "Properties" section
   * Find the relevant property in your list

3. **Download the Certificate**:
   * Locate the off-plan registration entry
   * Select the download or view option
   * Save the digital copy for your records and sharing with brokers

### Option 3: Through Real Estate Registration Department

If the above options aren't successful:

1. **Visit the Abu Dhabi Real Estate Registration Department**:
   * Bring all purchase documentation
   * Present personal identification
   * Complete the certificate request form

2. **Submit the Application**:
   * Pay the applicable fees
   * Provide contact information for delivery
   * Receive a tracking number

3. **Collection**:
   * Typically available within 5-10 business days
   * Can be collected in person or delivered electronically

## Associated Fees

Fees for obtaining pre-registration certificates vary based on several factors:

* **Developer Fees**: Range from 0-500 AED depending on the developer
* **Government Fees**: Typically 250-500 AED if requested through official channels
* **Expedited Processing**: Additional 100-200 AED for urgent requests
* **Replacement Copies**: Usually incur a nominal fee of 50-100 AED

## What to Do If Certificate Cannot Be Located

In some cases, especially for older purchases, the certificate might be difficult to locate. If this occurs:

1. **Check if Registration Occurred**: Not all developers historically registered off-plan sales
2. **Request Property Verification**: Ask ADREC to verify if the property is registered
3. **Initiate Registration Process**: If never registered, begin the registration process
4. **Provide Alternative Documentation**: Submit purchase agreement and payment receipts for verification

## Certificate Format and Information

A valid pre-registration certificate typically includes:

* Property identifier and unit number
* Project name and developer details
* Buyer's full name and identification
* Purchase price and payment plan status
* Certificate number (critical for Madhmoun permits)
* Issue date and authorized signatures

## Important Notes

* Certificates are mandatory for advertising off-plan properties through Madhmoun
* Brokers cannot proceed with permit applications without the certificate number
* Digital copies are generally acceptable for the permit process
* Certificates become obsolete once the final title deed is issued
