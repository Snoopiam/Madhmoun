# Refund Policy for Madhmoun Permit Cancellation

## General Policy Overview

The current policy for Madhmoun permits is that **no refunds are provided for cancelled permits**. This applies to all permit types, including:

* Rental property permits
* Sale property permits
* Developer project permits

This no-refund policy applies regardless of:
* How much time remains on the permit
* The reason for cancellation
* Who initiated the cancellation

## Rationale Behind the No-Refund Policy

The no-refund approach has been implemented for several reasons:

1. **Administrative Efficiency**: Streamlining the process without complex refund calculations
2. **System Integrity**: Encouraging careful consideration before permit application
3. **Service Cost Recovery**: Fees cover verification and system maintenance costs that occur upon issuance
4. **Market Stability**: Preventing permit speculation or frequent cancellations

## Cancellation Process

While refunds are not available, cancelling a permit is still important when appropriate:

1. **Initiating Cancellation**:
   * Log into the AdRec platform
   * Navigate to the Madhmoun module
   * Select "Cancel Permit" service
   * Select the permit to be cancelled
   * Submit the cancellation request

2. **Approval Requirements**:
   * Both parties involved in the permit must approve the cancellation
   * For properties with shared ownership, only one landlord's approval is sufficient

3. **Effect of Cancellation**:
   * The permit is immediately deactivated
   * The property becomes eligible for new permits if the cap has been reached
   * Notifications are sent to all stakeholders
   * Integration with advertising platforms triggers listing removal

## Scenarios Requiring Permit Cancellation

Despite the no-refund policy, cancelling permits is necessary in several situations:

* When a property is sold or rented
* When you no longer wish to advertise a property
* When permit details need to be changed (requires cancellation and new application)
* When exclusivity status needs to be changed
* When the relationship between parties has terminated

## Alternatives to Consider

Since refunds are not available, consider these alternatives:

1. **Short Duration Planning**: Initially select shorter permit durations if unsure about long-term needs
2. **Renewal Option**: Remember permits can be renewed if needed, potentially at lower renewal rates
3. **Property Reassignment**: Consider whether other properties might benefit from advertising
4. **Timing Considerations**: Plan permit applications close to when you're ready to market properties

## Future Policy Evolution

While the current policy does not allow refunds, the Madhmoun system continues to evolve:

* Feedback on all policies is welcomed via support@dari.ae
* Future phases may introduce more flexible options
* Policy adjustments may be considered as the system matures
* Annual packages may eventually be introduced based on market feedback

## Special Circumstances

For exceptional situations or disputes regarding permit cancellations, contact:
* support@dari.ae for general inquiries
* Your account manager for high-volume users
* ADREC customer service for escalated concerns

Remember that while the permit fee is non-refundable, cancelling unused permits promptly is still important for market transparency and to make properties available for new permit applications when applicable.
