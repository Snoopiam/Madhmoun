# Process and Fees for Obtaining a Pre-Registration Certificate

For property owners in Abu Dhabi who do not have a pre-registration certificate for their off-plan property, this guide outlines the process, requirements, and associated fees.

## What is a Pre-Registration Certificate?

A pre-registration certificate (also called an off-plan registration certificate) is an official document that:

* Confirms ownership rights for off-plan properties
* Contains essential property details and a unique identifier
* Is required for Madhmoun permit applications
* Serves as an interim document before final title deed issuance

## Process for Obtaining a Certificate

### Step 1: Gather Required Documentation

Prepare the following documents:
* Original Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA)
* Proof of identity (Emirates ID/passport)
* Proof of payment (receipts for installments paid)
* Power of Attorney (if applicable)
* Previous owner's documentation (if purchased from another investor)

### Step 2: Determine Certificate Status

Before applying, check if a certificate already exists:
* Log into your DARI account (www.dari.ae)
* Check the "Contracts" or "Properties" section
* Contact the developer's customer service
* Verify with the Abu Dhabi Real Estate Registration Department

### Step 3: Application Submission

If no certificate exists or it needs replacement:

**Option A: Through the Developer**
* Contact the developer's customer service department
* Submit required documentation
* Complete developer's application form
* Pay applicable fees
* Receive acknowledgment and tracking number

**Option B: Through ADREC**
* Visit an ADREC service center
* Submit documentation to the registration desk
* Complete the certificate request form
* Pay government fees
* Receive application receipt with reference number

### Step 4: Processing Period

* Standard processing: 5-7 business days
* Expedited processing: 2-3 business days (additional fee)
* Complex cases may require longer processing time

### Step 5: Certificate Collection

* Digital certificates: Delivered to registered email or DARI account
* Physical certificates: Collected from issuing office
* Verification of identity required for collection

## Fee Structure

Fees vary based on several factors:

### Developer Fees
* Administrative processing: 100-350 AED (varies by developer)
* Certificate issuance: 150-250 AED
* Expedited processing: Additional 100-200 AED

### Government Fees
* Registration verification: 100 AED
* Certificate issuance: 250 AED
* Knowledge and innovation fee: 20 AED

### Additional Services (Optional)
* Multiple copies: 50-100 AED per copy
* English translation: 100-150 AED
* Delivery service: 30-50 AED

## Timeline Expectations

* **Standard Process**: 7-10 business days from application to issuance
* **Expedited Process**: 3-5 business days (with additional fee)
* **Complex Cases**: May require 15-20 business days (properties with legal considerations)

## Important Considerations

* Certificates are issued in Arabic by default (translations available)
* The certificate must be in the current owner's name
* Properties in certain zones may have different requirements
* Certificate information must match the original SPA
* ADGM properties (Reem Island, Al-Maria Island) follow different procedures

## What to Do If Certificate Cannot Be Obtained

In some cases, particularly for older properties or specific developments, obtaining a certificate may be challenging. Alternative approaches include:

1. **Developer Letter**: Request an official letter confirming ownership
2. **SPA Verification**: Submit the SPA for direct verification by ADREC
3. **Legal Assistance**: Engage a real estate legal specialist
4. **Regularization Process**: Some developments have special processes for unregistered units

## Certificate Usage

Once obtained, the certificate can be:
* Used for Madhmoun permit applications
* Provided to brokers for property marketing
* Used as proof of ownership until title deed issuance
* Referenced for property transactions
