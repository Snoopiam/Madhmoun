# Permit Requirements for Private Company Accounts

## Understanding Private Company Account Types

In the context of Madhmoun permits, "private company accounts" can refer to several different entities, each with specific requirements:

1. **Private Real Estate Brokerage Companies**
   * Licensed brokerage firms operating as private companies
   * Primary users of the broker permit functionality

2. **Property-Owning Companies**
   * Companies that own real estate assets directly
   * Can initiate permit applications as owners

3. **Property Management Companies**
   * Firms managing properties on behalf of owners
   * Limited to rental permit applications

4. **Developer Companies**
   * Development firms with registered projects
   * Can obtain project-wide permits

## Account Setup Requirements

For any private company to access the Madhmoun system, the following must be in place:

### Pre-Registration Verification
* Valid trade license registered with relevant authorities
* Proper commercial registration
* Appropriate real estate activity license (for brokers and property management)
* Registration in the ADREC system

### Administrator Setup
* Company administrator registered with UAE Pass
* Administrator linked to company account

### Employee Configuration
* Staff members requiring access must be registered in the system
* Administrator must grant appropriate Madhmoun permissions
* Staff UAE Pass accounts linked to company profile

## Social Media and Online Advertising Requirements

Private companies face the same permit requirements as individuals for online advertising:

* **Mandatory Permit**: All property advertisements on any digital platform require a valid permit
* **Company Representation**: Advertisements must clearly show which company is advertising
* **Broker Identification**: The specific broker responsible must be identified
* **Permit Display**: Permit numbers must be visible on all advertisements
* **Platform Integration**: Listings on major platforms require verification through Madhmoun

## Specific Requirements by Company Type

### For Brokerage Companies

* Certificate numbers required for property verification

### For Property Management Companies
* Valid property management agreements must be registered

## Verification Process

The verification process for private companies may include:

1. **License Validation**: Checking current license status
2. **Ownership Verification**: Confirming property rights
3. **Representative Authentication**: Ensuring proper authorization
4. **Activity Scope Check**: Verifying permitted business activities
5. **Compliance Review**: Ensuring adherence to real estate regulations

## Important Considerations

* Changes in company structure or licensing must be updated in the system
* Non-compliant advertisements may result in penalties for the company
* Companies are responsible for employee activity under their account
