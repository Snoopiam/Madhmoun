# Clarification on Eligibility for Initiating Permit Applications on Madhmoun

## Current Limitations for Individual Landlords

Currently, individual landlords are excluded from directly initiating applications on the AdRec platform using the Madhmoun service. This limitation is temporary and may change in future updates to the system.

## Who Can Initiate Applications

The following entities are currently eligible to initiate permit applications:

1. **Real Estate Developers**
   * Companies with registered development projects
   * Can apply for project-wide permits

2. **Brokers and Brokerage Firms**
   * Licensed real estate brokers
   * Registered brokerage companies

3. **Property Management Companies**
   * With valid property management agreements
   * Limited to rental permit applications only

4. **Companies that Own Properties**
   * Business entities that own real estate assets
   * Must have proper documentation of ownership

## Role of Individual Landlords

While individual landlords cannot initiate applications directly, they play a crucial role in the permit process:

* **Approval Authority**: Landlords must approve applications initiated by brokers or management companies
* **Certificate Provision**: Must provide title deed or registration certificate information to brokers
* **Login Access**: Can access the system via UAE Pass (for residents) or username/password (for non-residents)
* **Application Review**: Can review all details before approval
* **Multiple Application Management**: Can approve multiple broker applications for the same property (up to three for sales)

## Future Changes

ADREC has indicated that this limitation is temporary, with plans to extend the service to individual landlords in the future as adoption increases. This phased approach allows for:

* Smoother system implementation
* Focus on professional users initially
* Testing and refinement of processes
* Gradual expansion of user base

## Workaround for Individual Landlords

Until direct access is enabled, individual landlords who wish to advertise their properties have these options:

1. Work with a licensed broker who can initiate the application
2. Engage a property management company with a formal agreement
3. If applicable, use a company structure that owns the property

## Rationale for Current Limitation

The temporary restriction helps ensure:

* Professional standards in initial implementation
* Proper verification processes
* Training and familiarity with the system among professional users first
* Controlled scaling of the platform

For the latest updates on eligibility changes, landlords should monitor announcements from ADREC or contact support@dari.ae with specific questions.
