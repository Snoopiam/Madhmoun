* Sale properties: 70 AED + VAT (1 month) or 140 AED + VAT (2-3 months)

## Important Considerations

### Single Permit, Multiple Platforms
Once you obtain a permit for a property, that same permit allows you to advertise on:
* Your own company website
* Major platforms like Bayut and Property Finder
* Social media channels
* Email marketing
* Any other digital medium

There is no need for separate permits for different platforms, but each property requires its own permit.

### Display Requirements
When advertising on your own website:
* The Madhmoun permit number must be clearly displayed
* The broker name must match the permit holder
* Adding a QR code is recommended but not mandatory
* Property details must match those in the permit

### Compliance Monitoring
ADREC employs AI monitoring tools that scan websites for property advertisements, including company websites. Non-compliant listings may result in:
* Notifications to remove content
* Potential penalties
* Impact on broker standing

## Benefits of Compliant Website Advertising

* **Enhanced Credibility**: Government verification increases client trust
* **Competitive Differentiation**: Demonstrates regulatory compliance
* **Reduced Liability**: Eliminates risk of penalties
* **Market Alignment**: Ensures consistency with industry standards
