# Guidance on QR Code and Permit Requirements for Social Media Ads

## Permit Requirements for Digital Advertising

All property advertisements in the Abu Dhabi real estate market, including those on social media platforms, now require valid Madhmoun permits. This applies to:

* Social media posts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
* WhatsApp messages in public or group chats
* Online classifieds
* Email marketing campaigns
* Company websites
* Digital brochures and flyers

## Display Requirements for Permit Information

### Minimum Requirement
At minimum, **all digital advertisements must display the Madhmoun permit number**. This applies to all platforms and formats.

### Enhanced Authentication
While not strictly mandatory, adding a QR code that links to the permit verification is highly recommended, especially for:
* Social media posts
* Company websites
* Digital brochures
* Any platform without guaranteed listing verification

### Benefits of Including QR Codes
* Adds an additional layer of authenticity
* Allows potential clients to verify the listing instantly
* Demonstrates professionalism and compliance
* Differentiates your listings from potential non-compliant advertisers

## Format and Placement Guidelines

### Permit Number Display
* Must be clearly visible
* Should appear in a consistent location on all advertisements
* Recommended format: "Madhmoun Permit: [Number]"
* Should be in a legible font size

### QR Code Implementation
* Should link directly to permit verification
* Ideally placed in a corner of images or at the bottom of text
* Must be of sufficient size to be scannable
* Should not obscure important property features in images

## Exceptions and Special Cases

### Direct Professional Communications
Private, direct communications between agents within the same company are exempt from permit requirements. However, once the communication moves to:
* Group chats with external parties
* Client-facing messages
* Public forums

The permit requirements apply.

### Existing Advertisements
All existing advertisements on social media and other platforms have a one-month grace period from the official launch date to either:
* Add the required permit information
* Remove the advertisements if permits cannot be obtained

## Compliance Monitoring

ADREC employs AI monitoring tools to scan social media and online platforms for property advertisements. Non-compliant listings may result in:
* Notifications to remove content
* Potential penalties for repeated violations
* Removal requests sent to platform administrators

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. Create templates for your social media posts that include designated space for permit information
2. Generate and save QR codes for each property permit for easy access
3. Train all team members on the requirements, including those who manage social media
4. Conduct an audit of existing online content to ensure compliance within the grace period
5. Consider adding a brief explanation of the Madhmoun verification system to build client trust

By properly implementing these requirements, real estate professionals can ensure compliance while enhancing the credibility of their listings in Abu Dhabi's increasingly regulated and professional market.
