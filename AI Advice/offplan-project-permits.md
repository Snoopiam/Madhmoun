# Process Guide: Obtaining Madhmoun Permits for Off-Plan Projects

## Two Scenarios for Off-Plan Properties

There are two distinct scenarios for obtaining Madhmoun permits for off-plan properties, each with its own process:

1. **Resale by Individual Purchaser**: When a broker is helping an individual sell their off-plan property in the secondary market
2. **Developer Project Listing**: When listing a full off-plan development project directly from the developer

## Scenario 1: Resale of Individual Off-Plan Units

### Process Overview
For brokers helping clients sell off-plan properties they've purchased:

1. **Obtain Certificate from Purchaser**
   * Request the off-plan registration certificate from the purchaser
   * This certificate contains a unique identifier (typically starts with year number, e.g., "2024" or "2025" followed by zeros)

2. **Access Madhmoun Permit Application**
   * Log in to the AdRec platform (www.dari.ae) using UAE Pass
   * Switch to company account
   * Navigate to the Madhmoun module
   * Select "Request Advertising Permit"

3. **Search for Property**
   * When adding properties, use the certificate number search option
   * Enter the certificate number from the off-plan registration document
   * The system will fetch the property details from official records

4. **Complete Application**
   * Specify permit details (duration, exclusivity)
   * Submit for landlord approval
   * Process payment upon approval (standard sales property fees apply)

### Timing and Fees
* Processing time: Minutes to hours (depends on landlord approval speed)
* Fees: Standard sales property fees (125 AED+VAT for one month, 250 AED+VAT for 2-3 months)

## Scenario 2: Developer Project Listings

### Process Overview
For developers listing their off-plan projects:

1. **Developer Initiates Application**
   * Developer logs into AdRec platform using UAE Pass
   * Switches to developer company account
   * Accesses Madhmoun module
   * Selects "Request Advertising Permit"

2. **Project Selection**
   * Developer selects the registered project from their account
   * All units within the project can be covered under one permit

3. **Broker Assignment**
   * Developer can specify which broker companies are authorized to advertise the project
   * Multiple brokers can be authorized under the same project permit

4. **Payment and Activation**
   * Developer completes payment (25,000 AED for 3-month mandatory period)
   * Permit is activated immediately upon payment
   * Authorized brokers can begin advertising

### Timing and Fees
* Processing time: Immediate upon payment (no approval cycle required)
* Fee: 25,000 AED per project (mandatory 3-month period)
* Renewal: Same fee for additional 3-month periods

## Important Considerations

### For Individual Unit Resales
* If the purchaser doesn't have their off-plan registration certificate, they can:
  - Contact the developer to request a copy
  - Log into their AdRec account and download it from the contracts section
  - Visit the developer's office with ID to request a replacement

### For Developers
* All projects must be properly registered with relevant authorities
* The developer account must have all projects properly listed
* The 25,000 AED fee is per project, regardless of the number of units

### For Brokers
* Always verify the authenticity of off-plan registration certificates
* Ensure the seller is the registered purchaser on the certificate
* Be aware that off-plan properties in ADGM areas (Reem Island, Al-Maria Island) are currently excluded

By following these processes, stakeholders can ensure compliant advertising of off-plan properties while maintaining the verification standards that are central to the Madhmoun initiative.
