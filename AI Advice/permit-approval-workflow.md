# Clarification on Permit Approval Workflow and Restrictions on AdRec Platform

## Permit Application Process Overview

The permit application process on the AdRec platform using Madhmoun involves several roles and approval stages. Understanding this workflow is essential for efficiently navigating the system.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initiation Phase
* Eligible initiator (broker, developer, property management company) logs in via UAE Pass
* Switches to company account
* Accesses Madhmoun module (requires proper permissions)
* Selects "Request Advertising Permit" service
* Specifies role, permit purpose (rent/sale), duration (1-3 months), and exclusivity status

### 2. Property Selection Phase
* For property management companies: Properties under management agreements appear automatically
* For brokers selling properties: Must enter certificate number from title deed
* For off-plan properties: Uses off-plan registration certificate number (typically starts with year number followed by zeros)
* Multiple properties can be selected in one application (fees apply per property)

### 3. Review and Submission
* System displays all selected properties with details
* Initiator reviews information for accuracy
* If exclusivity selected, system provides additional confirmation
* Application is submitted to the other party (landlord/broker/developer) for approval

### 4. Approval Phase
* Other party receives notification
* Logs in via UAE Pass or username/password
* Reviews application details
* Can approve, return with comments, or reject
* If returned, initiator can make corrections and resubmit

### 5. Payment Phase
* Upon approval, application routes to broker for payment
* Broker reviews final application
* Selects payment method (credit card or wallet balance)
* Completes payment transaction

### 6. Activation
* Permit activated immediately upon payment
* Valid from payment date for selected duration
* Permit certificate and receipt available for download
* Permit number can be used immediately for advertising

## Key Restrictions and Rules

### Property Eligibility
* Properties must be free of any blocks or restrictions
* Rental properties must be enrolled in Tautiq (have PRP or UNT number)
* ADGM properties (Reem Island and Al-Maria Island) are currently excluded from the service

### Off-Plan Properties
* Off-plan properties can be included using registration certificate numbers
* For resale: Purchaser must provide off-plan registration certificate to broker
* For new projects: Developers can apply for project-wide permits (25,000 AED for 3 months)

### Permit Limitations
* Exclusive permits: Only one broker can advertise the property
* Non-exclusive permits: Unlimited for rentals, up to three brokers for sales
* Cannot change exclusivity during renewal (requires cancellation and new application)
* Property management companies can only issue rental permits

### Activation and Duration
* Permits activate immediately upon payment
* Duration starts from payment date
* Automatically cancels if property is sold or rented
* Can be renewed while active (adds to remaining duration)

Understanding this workflow and its restrictions helps users navigate the permit application process efficiently while ensuring compliance with AdRec requirements.
