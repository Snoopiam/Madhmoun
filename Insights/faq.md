# Madhmoun Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

**Q: Is Madhmoun mandatory for all real estate transactions?**

A: Madhmoun applies to all areas of Abu Dhabi except Reem Island and Al-Maria Island, which fall under ADGM jurisdiction.

**Q: What is the difference between Madhmoun and American MLS?**  
A: Madhmoun is government-backed with title deed verification, while American MLS is managed by broker associations. Madhmoun currently allows up to three listings per property, while American MLS strictly allows one.

## Permit Questions

**Q: How much does a permit cost?**  
A: Permit costs vary based on property type (rent/sale) and duration (1-3 months). For rentals: 50-115 AED+VAT; for sales: 125-250 AED+VAT. Fees apply per property.

**Q: Are annual packages available for firms?**

**Q: How long does it take to get a permit approved?**  
A: If all parties are responsive, permits can be issued within minutes through the fully automated system.

**Q: Can I list a property that already has exclusive representation?**  
A: You cannot advertise a property with an exclusive permit assigned to another broker, but you can still sell it without online advertising.

## Technical Questions

**Q: What documents are needed to get a permit?**  
A: No documents need to be uploaded. Brokers only need the certificate number from the landlord's title deed or off-plan registration certificate.

**Q: How do non-resident landlords approve permits?**  
A: Non-resident landlords can approve via username/password login to the DARI platform (as opposed to UAE Pass used by residents).

**Q: What happens to advertisements when a property is sold?**  
A: Advertisements should be removed or marked as sold. The permit is automatically cancelled when the property is sold or rented.

**Q: How can I report issues or suggest improvements?**  
A: Send an email to support@dari.ae with your feedback or challenges.

## Compliance Questions

**Q: What happens if I advertise without a permit?**  
A: ADREC has AI monitoring tools to detect unauthorized advertising, which may result in penalties from regulatory authorities.

**Q: Is a QR code required for advertisements?**  
A: A permit number is sufficient for website advertisements, but adding a QR code provides an additional layer of authenticity, especially for social media.

**Q: Do WhatsApp or social media posts require permits?**  
A: Yes, any public online communication about properties for sale/rent requires a permit, including social media and messaging apps.

**Q: Will the system address fake pricing listings?**
